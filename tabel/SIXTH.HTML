        <h3>
            Most HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories â€” these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a member of any of these categories.
            <ul>
 <li>There are three types of content categories:

    <b>    Main content categories, which describe common rules shared by many elements.<b></b>
    <mark>  Form-related content categories, which describe rules common to form-related elements.
    Specific content categories, which describe rare categories shared only by a few elements, sometimes only in a specific context. </mark></li> </ul>
